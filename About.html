<h3><a id="Background_0"></a>Background</h3>
<p>The idea of BEEFS came into existence after workshopping for a Minimal Computing graduate course at the University of Victoria. At first, the idea seemed to be absurd with how it would serve as a means to represent the negative relationships (beefs) between two authors. After much brainstorming and narrowing down what BEEFS could realistically become thereafter, the idea became a project. As stated before, BEEFS would create relations between authors through their confrontations be it (as we came up with these three different categories) through physical attacks, attacks to each other’s craft (professional), or attacks on each other’s person (psychological). The main reason as to why we chose to divide up BEEFS into these three categories came up from the need of having to narrow down the different (and often rather creative) ways that authors expressed their dislikes towards each other. Besides classifying said interactions through the three aforementioned categories, we also quantify the severity of said confrontation in a scale from 0-10. The attribution of a score is purely subjective, although we try to justify it as much as possible through compare and contrast of what we think are the most severe cases of aggravation within these three categories; our biases obviously play a role when it comes to evaluating the BEEF. One main reason as to why BEEFS currently evaluate beefs between authors comes from our close proximity as well as interest since we both are students of English literature; this being the case, we were actually curious to see how authors acted negatively against each other, and we were rather surprised by how creative some of the attacks were such as shooting another author’s book to masterful verbal sparring that authors had with each other. One would think that authors would behave in a more civilized manner, but we were surprised by how much loathing some authors had against each other (and up to a certain degree, we were also rather excited to explore these relationships). As it stands, the current iteration of BEEFS is merely a barebones prototype that with some more time, will be further developed, ultimately branching off into other BEEFS outside of the literary world, with much more functionality and polish. Nonetheless, the idea of BEEFS is greatly presented with the current iteration.</p>
<h3><a id="Development_4"></a>Development</h3>
<p>The current iteration of BEEFS is made up of mainly HTML and CSS. The project has been developed in roughly around a month’s time and this being the case, there are still some functional aspects that we would have liked to include but as they stand, they are just placeholders for the time being (the search bar on the main page). The site also has a database backend, but it is not functionally integrated to the site as a whole; ideally, this database would work in conjunction with the search bar to more easily provide users a means to search the authors found in BEEFS. Most of the site’s functionality is rather barebones, but they serve as a foundation to later update upon as well as expand the breadth of BEEFS as a whole. Technical limitations did play a role on how limited (functionally) the site currently is, yet at the same time, this worked to out benefit for we could justify said limitations as part of the minimalist design that we wanted to present through the site. We minimalize the amount of agency that the user currently has over the site (at least currently, although in the long run the user may have a far greater degree of agency once the search bar functionality is fully implemented to the site, but as it stands, the user is limited to click on what they want to see, limited to the amount of information we have coded into the site (for the time being, we only have data from a selected few authors from our rather lengthy list of over 100 authors). Again, this stripping down from our original shaped the current iteration of BEEFS, a fairly slick, easy to use website with a minimalist aesthetic going for it. On one final note, as is, we tried to program the site in such a way that it could be as accessible as possible for people with disabilities. The site is very word heavy making text to speech programs be able to read through the site with ease. The color scheme we utilized also works in favor for those that may be color blind (red and beige do not blend into each other). Again, this does not mean that there is no room for improvement when it comes to tackling the site’s accessibility for we intend for BEEFS to be enjoyed by everyone and anyone.</p>
<h3><a id="Rationale_8"></a>Rationale</h3>
<p>BEEFS tries to emphasize the idea that not all relationships come from positive interaction, instead, one can identify how is it that through confrontations links between people are often created. Again, BEEFS tries to address this oversight highlighting negative interactions between authors and to what type of interaction (physical, professional, psychological) each author had. Ideally, BEEFS would be a repository of anti-social or confrontational behavior between authors; serving as a means to provide yet another aspect that could link authors with each other. This rationale also comes out of the idea that there is really no other site on the web that addresses these types of interaction, they always focus on the positive links that people have with each other but rarely address any falling out that might have occurred. It is also due to the lack of this specific type of niche (only some internet articles had this type of analysis, but no web page has the BEEFS idea as its main theme) oof author confrontation became the driving force for us to actually go on and develop what started off as a rather silly idea into an actually functional project. Again, this site has the potential of addressing beefs outside the realm of authors and can be applied to any celebrity-level person that might have had a confrontation with someone else. Ideally, like stated before, this site has the potential to become a one-stop repository for researching any sort of confrontations that a celebrity had as well as providing citations to (lightly speaking) legitimize the confrontation, giving it a more academic feel to the website as well. BEEFS is for all, from the gossip enthusiast to the ivory tower scholar, from being a rabbit hole of celebrity confrontations to a place of scholarly record of said confrontations; in short, BEEFS is meant to be accessible to anyone.</p>
<h3><a id="Context_of_Use_12"></a>Context of Use</h3>
<p>BEEFS could be utilized to assess the different types of confrontations that authors had and against whom these confrontations were against. Again, this goes back to the idea of BEEFS building upon rather anti-social networks with authors, which in part could lead to research that may link two authors, albeit, in a rather unconventional way. BEEFS also seeks to flip-reverse the idea that every social network ideally is meant to be used users through positive taxonomies (friends, followers, etc.) whereas, in reality, most of these sites are but merely a grounds for verbal battle (for instance Twitter). BEEFS, therefore, seeks to break away from the friendlier aspect of social networks and makes apparent that people can create links with each other through negative interactions. Another possible context of use that comes out of BEEFS is how readers may approach authors critically via the proxy of attacks to their craft by other well-renown authors. With this in mind, readers then can assess if the criticism is made genuinely because of the work’s quality or if said criticism is the result of an author trying to directly affect another author’s livelihood through a beef that they may have against each other. This then puts yet another layer when it comes to approaching a work critically for right before one dives into the works, there is already a criticism on the work that may be more of an attack on the author rather than criticism against the craft and quality of the work itself.</p>
<h3><a id="Difficulties_Considerations_and_the_Future_16"></a>Difficulties, Considerations, and the Future</h3>
<p>As it stands, BEEFS is fairly barebones in comparison to the original idea of fully developing the project. The main difficulty that we faced when developing BEEFS was that we both lacked any extensive experience with coding and therefore we had to mostly learn as we went on with the project. As a result, the website had intended to have a database in its backend but they could not be implemented with the search bar that is found on the main page of BEEFS. Due to this, we had to come up with a workaround and therefore discarding the idea of actually having a functioning database on the site. Nonetheless, this does not mean that in the future this will not be implemented accordingly, for that is one of the many goals we have in mind to better improve the project throughout its future iterations. Another limitation that BEEFS might show comes in the form of the BEEFS that are found within the site. We had to narrow down our dataset out of fear of scope creep; this means that the site as it stands is but merely a visualization (albeit rather barebones) from what the site would look like. It is safe to say that BEEFS, as it stands, is a work in progress which we both wish to further improve upon.</p>
