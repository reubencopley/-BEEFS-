## 1.	Outline of projects outline, design, motivation and content

!!!BEEFS!!! is a project that arose out of the Wireframe workshop. Following the design of the Criterion visualization I (Reuben) was struck by the connections referred to in Brooke, Heidi, and Rachel's Romantic network idea. The networking of individuals only by the disagreements and negative interactions seemed interesting. After that workshop I sat down and sketched out a wireframe of sorts on paper based around the visual inspiration of collectible sports trading cards. It seemed to me that the mix of personality, information, and the physical nature of many "beefs" lent itself well to the baseball/hockey/collectible card trading aesthetic/trope. The idea comes out of the similarity in form between soprts trading cards and promotional boxing posters. I thought it would be an easy format to design around. Initially I was thinking about it as a celebrity "beefs" site, a la TMZ, but I realized it would also lend itself well to sub "beefs" (e.g. literary, sports, music, arts) and so, for the purposes of this course and this project I thought literary "beefs" would be most appropriate. 

The design stems from the physical format of the trading card. The central page would emulate a boc of collectible cards on a field resembling a table or floor. The cards would be visible along their top edges and would be selected according to a pre-determined organizational principle, perhaps selected by the user (alphabetical, type of "beef", literary movement, language, nation). You would then, by keyboard or mouse flip through the cards revealing the top of the card with the name. When selected the card would be slipped out of the case and superimpose/ become foregrounded. Clicking or typing [spc/tab/???] would flip between front and back of card. The front would be an image of the individual, with a standardized aesthetic look based on eras. The back of the card would contain biographical information. Weighted/coloured lines would flow from the edge of the card to cards layed out on the field. The field cards would appear when the main card is selected and would be comprised of those individuals the main card has "beefs" with. The weighted/coloured lines would be categorized around "types of beef". The rival cards could then be clicked/typed on to be foregrounded, and could also be selected to see who they had beefs with. 

The content would be the least minimal thing about the project, in that everything would have to be curated. The data could be streamlined once determined, but there would be considerable research involved initially. The visual design would likely be standardized, but the images would have to be creative commons. Ideally there would be sounds, probably edited and/or recorded with audacity. In some instances video might also be interesting, for instance the "beef" between Norman Mailer and William F Buckley and the recording wherein Buckley threatens Vidal with violence in their '68 debate. Due to copyright issues this may not be possible, but it would be an interesting addition. In future it may be possible to expand the idea given the amazing access to "beefs" through social media like twitter/Facebook/Worldstar Hiphop???
