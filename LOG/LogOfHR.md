###E-lit and survey of DH
What is digital/cultural/literary studies?
McPherson  (Lierature of the American South)
*About/in/through
*How a project stands on its own?
*How do “things” work like essays/work on their own?
*The relationship during and after production
*The problem of completion/is there such a thing?
*Walt Whitman and the ongoing revision of Leaves of Grass
*Walking around something as opposed to embedded within the thing
*The problem with thinking and doing
*Scholar and Staff
*Technical work as service
*How can you think through technologies?
*Are ideas separate from materials?
*Geographies of disciplines
*Vulnerability working with new media can make scholars anxious or nervous
*DH not congealed (glitches, bugs) 
*Mcp affirms the nervousness 
*Critical/creative binary
*Research creation? / Research?
*Collaboration?

The lack of neutrality of technology / value-laden
Forms of vision – research around computer vision
Not just thinking abut, but also in and through
Conventions and modes articles, politics of citation and reference, canons and corpora
Keep the mess small, controlled chaos
Media vs literary media textual studies
Skepticism of DH from literary studies tradition
“critical distance/ objectivity” not true with literary studies anyways 
Exhaustion of utopian internet ideals
Vectors – scholarship you can’t print
Boutique scholarship – 
Secrets – women in California prison system
Wendy Chun – Anne Frieberg
Scalar – wordpress for media studies (Jentery helped develop it)
Flash scholarship
Kirschenbaum (book history/textual history)
DH is a community, it is a discipline, there is a distinct discipline
Origin story vs practice 
The thing you do within your research / cultural historical formation that moves those being spoken to
Local phenomenon vs networks – not isolated, but not visible to local communities
DH as METHOD (division of content/standards) based around historical community
A combination of digital computing and literary community – not just of DH
Dystopia – 24/7 research – online life
The question of labour and separation of labour from production?
Questions of funding – infrastructure 
Computational vs Digital Humanities
Hayles
###E-lit primer/survey
Hypertext fiction – forking paths, inquiry that never ends, non-linear, never-ending
Network Fiction – work to network of fictions that speak to each other/collaborative/serendipitous
IF – Artificial intelligence, algorithm, games and e-lit (Pottermore), input of text as opposed to click, ELIZA (psychological labour), digital labour
Locative – in situ, performative, GPS located, site specific, the breakdown between art and literature, more inclined to glitches, experience beyond screen, 
Code work – create scripts for novel or poem, productive of literature, bots, comment on code, esoteric language (executable language), Brainfuck, the question of utilitarianism of programming (art and uselessness)
Generative art/generative text – output, script outputs text, video makes more video, procedural art, sound making more sound.
Hermeneutics – digging into finding meaning, the intent, procedural work as artificiality, normative assumptions, individual genius, Kerouac (blech), intent as humanist norm
Defending the “play” of DH, intent procedure
Flashpoem – Cinematic poem, poem that feels like cinema, intentional, not subtle

###What do you think you are doing to interpretation when you insert into/work in digital environment?
###Decision on/of encoding? Affirming/ambivalent?
 
Joey’s comment on note 60 sentence. The totality of Digital as encompassing. Digital as capitalism, that which cannot be emulated, preserved, digitized? Digitization efforts. Even if everything can be digitized, will it be? Digital insecurity? What do we not want to digitize? 
Interaction – what does that word mean? 
Lev Manovich in his influential The Language of New Media.
Characteristics of materials we are working with, note 91. The five principles of new media.
Reduction, transposition into binary, what are the cultural consequences? 
Object oriented programming – modularity, variability
Numerical representation 
Original copy vs version – iteration
Variability – technical work
Networked architectures (automation, sensors and actuators)
Transcoding
Automation – what occupations become machines
The compiler and programmer becoming programs

Electronic media is not print – the separability – preservation is a difficulty
Part of the preservation problem is unfamiliarity with previous medium, technology, systems, interfaces, et cetera
Ephemerality????????? Values of ephemerality?????????
Media archaeology? Media preservation?



##3 quick distinctions
*Digital literary studies – 1) the study and production of electronic literature (fine arts/comparative media) 2) computation to understand (distant reading) the misunderstood / data analysis / encoding / using computation to study literature (algorithmic criticism), Macroanalysis, Literature preservation
*Digital Cultural Studies – critiques of hegemony, gender, race, sexuality, media and communication studies (how are technologies culture? How are they culturally embedded?) Digital labour studies
*The production of culture through technologies, can you institute change? Is it interesting as art? 
Design????
Persistent issues across platforms, systems
Start with design as a question
Minimalism – raising the questions of ideology, the “morph”ology of the word, scope-creep, what are the ethics of creeping projects, across different economies? The bypass of digital? 


####Minimalism
Art context – 50s 60s art style, sculpture sound design themes (work with limited resources/fewest possible resources, lack of detail/compositional/complex/textural structures, static work/monochrome/silence/freeze frames, resistance to development or change, repetition, decontextualization toward questions of form, not indexical, impersonal/modernist/eschew ties to subjectivity, neutralize depth, conducive to commodification/elitist, reduction of ikea-fication/weight loss disappearance as ultimate minimalism/taste/fashion)
Flat, simple, lack of complexity
Examples
Ed- accessible at level of bandwidth and architecture
Log Jammer – network jammer made of logs, nature as minimalist trope
First Screening – bpNichols computer poem – BASIC
The Illuminator – projection interventions in public spaces (use of bikes, cars, public transit)
DH-USB – DH OS on USB disk/stick/drive, Arch Linux, customized, text as data (Tales – Memory-less OS)
Raspberry Pi – single-board minimal pc, arts, interactive exhibits, open-source
Sublime Text – text editor for code/markup/prose, distraction free text editor
Markdown – text to html conversion tool, to html/.doc/.docx/.pdf
Pandoc – converts any markup to another
pandoc -s xxxxxxxx.txt -o xxxxxxxx.html (command line)



Really like the YHCHI interview where they say:
YHC HI: Well, for us, choice doesn't equal fantasy. Or rather, you could argue that a lack of choice equals fantasy. After all, it's societal strictures and problems without evident solutions that inspire our longings and musings. People equate choice with democracy, but no one ever said that art and literature were democracies. We would like our own work to exert a dictatorial stranglehold on the reader.
Minimalism equals fantasy, inspires, invites solutions

####Log
*Case Studies/Readings
*WS documentation/materials
*Reflection
*Discussion
*Remarks
Mcpherson – media studies point of view
Kirschenbaum – English POV, textual studies, bibliography, origin story of DH
Hayles – preservation and ephemerality, 
Digital literary vs Digital Cultural studies
IDEA: The first sentence/the last sentence/arbitrary page number (100? 120 days of sentences? 100 days of solitude sentences)
Composing new media as scholarship (podcasts, video, production of media, design)
Skepticism of DH from design community
Seminar as introduction
Minimal computing/minimalist design
Different shades of minimalism
Histories of art – minimalism as framework or paradigm (60s 70s few resources, static work, compositionally simplistic, freeze frames, silence, repetition, impersonal, alienating, flat)
Minimalism as elitism – simple – commodification – the choice to be simple?
Markdown – syntax – file types – compilers – converters – file sizes – longevity of format – planned obsolescence – accessibility – conducive to responsive design – format/hardware flexibility

####Why would you want to create a minimal edition of a text? What are the advantages/disadvantages? Comparisons? Differences between reading and scholarly editions? 


Simplicity foregrounds content, the enable/inspires/enhances the reader’s subjectivity, 
Scholarly editions restricts exploration to the editors POV, bias, imaginative space
Minimal editions are often more accessible to a broader audience, scholarly editions are often paywalled, 
Eliminating additional content reduces production cost
Scholarly editions are heavily indebted to labour

Interface issues – interaction – How do we interact with minimalism
Simplicity of format – epub/ereader considerations
Log in Markdown??????????

YHCHI – Maximalist creation presented minimally, format is not necessarily accessible, 

Expanded Cinema – active, not passive, active engagement with/by audience, ephemeral

Audience reception and reaction – involvement
Differing approaches to audience – embodiment vs removal of agency
Political correlations
Text-based vs visual/film
Vernacular becoming elitist via academia
Bypassing passive and active to negotiation
Physical body in space
Building spaces for interaction
Media read by machine
The traces of what passed, indexical relations, traces, derrida
Media or behaviour happened

Games – 
For one person/ for specific purposes aside from mass entertainment

Language (LISP)
Live code music
Navigating code/ Sorenson critical reading the practice

####4 different interfaces:

1. All about time (apparatuses/time remaining/interface layer focusing on time) complete
1.	Space of text (highlight/possibilities) complete
1.	Annotation? (seen?lacking?interesting?) GENIUS/Hypothesis
1.	History/context of the text
1.	????????????
Keep it Simple

Use oriented/think about use/reduce the number of accessible features
Reduction of fields, reveal et cetera, simplicity of interface
Ideal function of a text (what is the text really about?)
What ideologies are present? 
Content vs design? Why are they separate? Are they separate? 

Tactical media, electronic surveillance theatre.
Space: separation of colon in Station of the Metro
Annotation: Double screen and highlighting, separated but yoked footer
Inserted annotation/embedded

####History/Context: 
The ending is fixed “John and Mary die” the events up to the fixed ending. 
Crickets, and silencio silencio		silencio silencio

*Python workshop should be inserted here?, or was this markdown workshop?????*

If you change the text does this still work? Interface design. Inseparable? Can content and interface be separated?
The interface without the txt at all? Can it be described without the text? Authorial intention.
Making the interface as contingency free as possible
Can you describe your text as “what it does?”
Not what does it mean.
Interface v. content
Translation – the bad translator
Galloway – interface effect “unworkable” the thing between
Doesn’t clearly turn this into that
Negotiation instead of use
Glitch as anti-minimalism
When things don’t work negotiation is foregrounded
Responsivity – across machines, from this to that
Space/time as values – what is negative space (absence/presence) why wait? 
Texture – engagement, how are people most obviously using? Marks/layers of use
Learnability – habit, the common language of interface, standardization, interpretation into habit.

##25 May 2017
Shift from functional to structural minimalism
Repetition in scholarly work (strategic reading/minimalist reading)
1st day – Markdown – not Markup – readable – sustainable – human centred – reduces conditions of production
Text Editors – not word processors – less interface – fewer proprietary formats (none of this applies to notepad++), less proprietary data – Strauss (Accelerando) – Cory Doctorow – conducive to writing across languages, across programming languages – reduction instead of expansion
Flat Development – simple sites – handcrafted rhetoric – large datasets are unnecessary – less bandwidth – less storage space – conducive to responsive design – mobile media has spurred a return to flat development - 
2nd day – functional minimalism – the use of features, increasing features to increase robustness, reduction/simplicity for expansion of interpretation/function, interfaces – (layout – use of space – fields/buttons/text-specific/agnostic) – are content and interface intertwined? Separable? Division of labour – audience? Who is the interface developer? Was it done for free? Is it a skin? Overlay? Mod-culture? 
Simplicity of access – culturally/intellectually/physically?
Mallarmé
Taking away agency from readers – start-stop
Kinetic poetry
Simple syntax – simple functions that are expandable
Reduction of features reduces learning curve – exploits may be present but not obvious
3rd Day – Interaction – Structural Minimalism
The structure of the thing – movement – metadata, navigation, menus, selection, 
Benjamin Bratton? The Stack?? Software and Sovereignty
Structuralism – 

####2 questions about mock-ups/wireframes –
What did you have to cut out to make it work?
The first wireframe mockups were highly focused on the narrative structure of the ee cummings poem we (hector and I) have# been working with. Because the poem is essentially a private conversation between two people, is gendered, and is intimate-it is very easy to slip/fall into specific modes of thought concerning interface (binaries/call-response/et cetera). So, for the final wireframe we cut out any reliance on content. The final mockup was independent of content and context, and thus became highly generalized.
Under what assumptions about text or audience was the cut made?
This/these cut(s) were made in an effort to avoid reliance on the content of one specific poem and instead to design a (hopefully) more universal interface. In doing this, we may have expanded the utility of the interface for certain segments of the population, such as those with altered visual fields, while still being accessible to those with auditory differences. 

In absentia – JR Carpenter
What is masked or obscured in the layers?
The Shape of History
Historical visualizations that are themselves historical
# anchor tags – html design principles – parallax design (bootstrap)
Assumptions about bodies and habits – questions of modality
Ethical ad-blocker – 

Text – collections – built environment

###1st workshop – May 25, 2017
Teaching – accessible in various formats – specific editions (but accessible)
Accessible online 
Ability to navigate themes in novel – text  (not obvious) ability to scan the text with those themes in mind, eco-criticism, queer theory (similar to annotation), 
Design text so students can scan – no search engine, find function, 
Eyes and ears – both visually and auditory
Structural issues – valid?

Select a collection of materials
Identify a theme (or exhibit title) for navigating theme
Select a space on campus
Detail and sketch
-	Materials and their location
-	Descriptions and their location				(Tactile, digital, both?)
-	Curatorial decisions and their location 

Collection
Agent/entity/actant – not corpus  (Corpus =collection /vs/ Agent = type of item)
5 Relationships/ways relates to things
At least 3 ways visualize edge weight (significance) distinction between, methods for visualizing connection/relationships

Visualizations – how reduction can be a problem but also an affordance for delivery
Not look at visualization as proof, but as inquiry
Quantitative expression – graphing, 
“mined resource” (tangible and easy to interpret)
Data is constructed, not mined
All data is cooked, no raw data.   ALL DATA! ALL RAW! RAW DATA ALL THE TIME!
How to make it robust, more complex, instead of using it simply as “proof”
Is something computably trackable
How to be precise? How to measure?
How do people understand what you are doing?
Casey Reyes – art based practitioner, expressive, not demonstrative
Distant reading, Moretti, Graphs, Maps, and Trees
Flatness, what happens when you flatten materials for navigation?
Scopecreep – visualizing scopecreep, 
Tuesday – An idea / feedback / 
Simple bots, scripts, programs, wireframes, simple exhibit, method for examining text
Project development – practical matters? 
Literary Beefs? 
Taking it apart? How does it work? 

##May 26 – Context of access – perceived complexity
Architectural minimalism is more about systems
Modularization/ modularity
Compiled/interpreted
Delegation of responsibility to components
How does something remember something? Trust? Is the algorithm trustworthy? What are the values incorporated into the algorithm?
Responsibility/ ethics
Allison Parrish’s Word Games
Ephemerides – procedural works to critique humanist intent and meaning
Exemblitivism – iain Higgins (exemplifies theory through use)
Prompts art modularity – parsed out (Wunderkammer)
Aesthetics of modularization


Tokens – item/integer/word
Parser-looks for 
Ambiguity – python does not do ambiguity
Redundancy – python is meant to limit redundancy
Literal – what you say is what it does

Integer – any value [int]
Strings – [“hello world”] all characters are counted (spc, et cetera)
Variables – I = ”Hello World”
Print – to screen
Module – script that contains multiple functions

PEMDAS
Errors=
Syntax – problem with characters (compositional problem)
Runtime – dependency of script on something that is not there, or that it simply cannot utilize in the way it should
Semantic – executes script but does not in the method intended, or with the desired result, or no result at all

Writing workshop – drafts – feedback
Presentation – not formal, but for audience – peer reviewed
Variables, integers, strings, 
Text analysis – creative uses of python (emulation of poetry)

Tweepy: 
Wordnik
TRONbot (Trump/Macron) (Trudeau/Macron) (Trump/Clinton): Corpora, machine learning patterns creating sentences.

Structural
Open and transparent to see how it functions

Architectural
Reducing complexity for longevity, modularity requires specific components – but each module is only responsible for one thing (dependencies), context of access

Compositional 
Context of use, serendipity, creativity of interpretation, no pro/pre-scription for navigation, results are unknown – 

Shelley Jackson – Patchwork Girl (adaptation of Frankenstein)
My body – Wunderkammer
Hypertext – unknown destinations
Gender and embodiment – 
Indeterminacy in structure of text

Tracery – Kate Compton
